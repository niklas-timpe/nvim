# Nikis NEOVIM Config


## Prerequisites

If you hit any further issue when trying to install it please let me know :)

## Installation

Clone this repot into you `~/.config/` directory named as `nvim` with:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:niklas-timpe/nvimo-veritas.git ~/.config/nvim
```


When doing that not all functions are not immediately set.
For that you need to do the following:


1. xxx
2. xxx

I think some functionalities still need some extra actions to be run. Of top of my head I don't remember them, but I will update this README when I do.



## CheatSheet
Here is a list of all important (custom) shortcuts:

Quick explanation for the notation: `<leader>` is a mapping for the space key in this config. You can remap the `<leader>` to your likings.
When `<leader>go` is mentioned, it means you press the space bar then `g` and then `o`.
